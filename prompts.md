## Prompt 1
Your task is to create HTML and CSS for a Call-to-Action section encouraging pet adoption and fostering.

The CTA section should be a tall, visually striking banner and include:
- A large main heading that encourages visitors to take action.
- A short description explaining the importance of fostering rescue animals.
- A call-to-action link styled as a bright, eye-catching button that stands out against the background.

Follow these guidelines:
- Use a nature-inspired, blue & teal color palette to convey trust, reliability, and calmness.
- Use a modern, easy-to-read font to enhance readability and design.
- Document the CSS with short comments that explain its purpose.

## Prompt 2
Add a simple header displaying the name of the site, 'PetQuest'.
- The header should be short and include the site name.
- Place the header above the Call-to-Action banner.
- Keep the design simple and aligned with the color palette used in the banner.

## Prompt 3
Set img/cta-bg.jpg as the background image for the banner. Apply a light overlay to keep the image subtle while ensuring the text remains clear and readable.

## Prompt 4
Below the banner, create a new section that displays the image 'img/pet.jpg' alongside additional information about fostering pets. Arrange them in two evenly sized columns, centered on the page.
